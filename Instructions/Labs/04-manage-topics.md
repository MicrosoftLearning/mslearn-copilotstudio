    > **Note**: The message should be updated to include the *Name* variable from the prior node, and should look similar to the screenshot above.

1. Select **Save**.

### Task 2.3 – Add nodes with natural language

In addition to adding updating existing nodes, you can use Copilot to add new ones.

1. Make sure that no node is selected by selecting the empty space around the nodes.

1. In the **Edit with Copilot** panel, in the **What do you want to do?** field, enter the following text:

    `Summarize the information collected in an adaptive card`

1. Select **Update**.

1. A message node with an Adaptive Card is added to the end of the topic.

    ![Screenshot of the message node with an Adaptive Card.](../media/message-node-adaptive-card.png)

1. Select the **Media** box in the Adaptive Card. The Adaptive Card properties should appear on the right of the screen.

    ![Screenshot of the Adaptive Card properties.](../media/adaptive-card-properties.png)

   Your Adaptive Card formula should look similar to the one above. If it doesn't, then you can paste in the formula below:

    ```json
    {
    type: "AdaptiveCard", 
        body: 
        [
            {
                type: "TextBlock",
                size: "Medium",
                weight: "Bolder",
                text: "Summary"    
            },
            {
                type: "FactSet",
                facts: 
                [
                    {
                        title: "Full Name",
                        value: Text(Topic.Name)
                    },
                    {
                        title: "Email Address",
                        value: Text(Topic.EmailAddress)
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                type: "TextBlock",
                text: "Thank you for providing the information."
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
